With this plugin you can give your players the opportunity to earn money by killing other players. This repository is not a *fork* of the original **KillMoney**, I only noticed that many people were waiting for *@Topic* to update the plugin by providing support for the new PocketMine-MP **API** 3.0.0, so I decided to make the request of many people.

Some features that come with this plugin:
- Minimum amount of money that the victim must have for the killer to obtain money from the victim
- Customizable amount of money that the killer earns and loses the victim
- Customizable messages in the config.yml with their respective descriptions (supports tags)
- Quick view of the settings and messages defined in the config.yml when using /killmoney (only OPs) (see permissions)
- Correct manipulation and release of RAM memory
